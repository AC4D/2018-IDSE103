Designers Make Things

Make things to throw away

Design has the power to cross all disciplines and business

Other disciplines create specification lists, spreadsheets, etc
Designers are the ones who make that all come to life.

Imagine writing a movie script and handing it off.

Designers as movie directors
Look, feel, tone
