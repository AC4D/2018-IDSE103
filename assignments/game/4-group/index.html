    <h5>IDSE103: Game Facilitation</h5>
    <h5>Group #4: Mariangela + Joshua</h5>

    <h1>Name of Game</h1>

    <p>Instructions...
    
    Every person in a group will receive one random scene in the form of a sentence. In a group of 10, two people will receive one scene and there will be 5 scenes in total.
They will have 4 min to draw that scene with as much detail as possible in order to accurately convey what the scene is
Once theyâ€™re done they will share their drawings with the group member that drew the same scene
They will share feedback with the other person with the same scene, and think on what they can improve for 1 minute
Once feedback gets provided, each person will go back to their seat and iterate on their scene for 2 min
After they are done, each person will hang all of their 4 drawings from the same scene next to each other
Everyone in the team will now try to guess what the scene was trying to convey.

Constraints:
NO devices allowed to reference objects, people or postures

Outcome:
The purpose of the activity will be to practice our ability to convey a single scene on paper/whiteboard as fast as possible.

List of Scenes:
Abraham Lincoln sitting in front of a house smoking a cigar
A kid petting a pug while hanging upside down 
A girl doing squats next to a water cooler
A businessman doing push-ups next to a punching bag
A guy laughing at a TV broken by a toaster
A woman trying out shoes at a Crocs store
A clown teaching French to a bunch of school kids
