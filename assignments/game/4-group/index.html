    <h1>Complicated Drawing</h1>

    <p>The game starts with each person in the room being given a random scene they must draw in under four minutes. After the two minutes are done it is revealed that for every scene there are two or more people that drew it. Each person pairs up with the person holding the same scene drawn and they compare their drawings. After two minutes of comparing all groups begin drawing that same scene again. This time they have two minutes to draw the scene but they have the ideas from their paired drawing partner and the practice of drawing the scene before. The game ends with all persons trying to guess each scene drawn.</p>
