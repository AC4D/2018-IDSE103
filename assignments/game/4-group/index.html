    <h2>Random Scenes</h2>

    <h3>Instructions...</h3>

    <p>Every person in a group will receive one random scene in the form of a sentence. In a group of 10, two people will receive one scene and there will be 5 scenes in total.</p>

<p>1. They will have 4 min to draw that scene with as much detail as possible in order to accurately convey what the scene is.
<p>2.Once theyâ€™re done they will share their drawings with the group member that drew the same scene</p>
<p>3.They will share feedback with the other person with the same scene, and think on what they can improve for 1 minute</p>
<p>O4.nce feedback gets provided, each person will go back to their seat and iterate on their scene for 2 min</p>
<p>5.After they are done, each person will hang all of their 4 drawings from the same scene next to each other</p>
<p>6.Everyone in the team will now try to guess what the scene was trying to convey</p>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>
NO devices allowed to reference objects, people or postures

<h3>Outcome:</h3>
The purpose of the activity will be to practice our ability to convey a single scene on paper/whiteboard as fast as possible.
