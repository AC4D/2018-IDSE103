    <h1>Random Scenes</h1>

    <p>
      Two persons in a group will receive one random scene
      They will have 4 min to draw that scene with as much detail as possible in order to accurately convey what the scene is
      Once theyâ€™re done they will share their drawings with the group member that drew the same scene
      They will share feedback with each other, and think on what they can improve for 1 minute
      Once feedback gets provided, each person will go back to their seat and iterate on their scene for 2 min
      After they are done, each person will hang all of their 4 drawings from the same scene next to each other

      Materials needed: 
      Paper
      Markers, different thicknesses
      Tape

      Constraints:
      NO devices allowed to reference objects, people or postures

      Outcome:
      The purpose of the activity will be to practice our ability to convey a single scene on paper/whiteboard as fast as possible.</p>
