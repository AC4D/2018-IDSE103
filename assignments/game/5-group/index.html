    <h1>Make Them Fly!</h1>
    </br> 
    
<p>Players: 4-16 players; groups of 2</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>

<p>Paper</p>
<p>Markers</p>
<p>Tape</p>


<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<h4>Step one – time limit 2 minutes</h4>
<p>
Your mission is to work together with your team mate in a private
area</p>
<p> Build an object from paper that will fly as far as possible </p>
<p> Do not let anyone see your object—remember, this is top secret </p>
<p> You may use as much paper and tape as you like </p>
<p> Your object must be decorate in some way so that it distinguishes
your object </p>
<p> Do not test (fly or toss) your object until step two </p>
<p> Get to work and then meet outside for a contest with the group in 2
minutes</p>

</br>

<h4> Step two – time limit 4 minutes </h4>
<p>Everyone meets outside for flight</p>
<p>Each group makes their object take flight one after the other </p>
<p>Determine which team’s object went the farthest, and which the least</p>
<p>For the team that went farthest, what worked well for you? </p>
<p>For the team that went the least far, what didn’t work well for you?</p>

</br>

<h4>Step three – time limit 6 minutes</h4>
<p>Your mission is to work together in a public and large group area</p>
<p>Build an object from paper that will fly as far as possible</p>
<p>You may prototype, test, and iterate your idea as many times as you
like</p>
<p>You may use as much paper and tape as you like</p>
<p>Your object must be decorate in some way so that it distinguishes
your object</p>
<p>Look at other team’s prototypes. Steal ideas.</p>
<p>Show others your prototypes and ask for input.</p>
<p>Make your object fly during a test within the time limit.</p>
<p>Iterate your prototype based on your own tests and feedback from
others as many times as possible within the time limit.</p>

</br>

<h4> Step four – time limit 4 minutes </h4>
<p>Everyone meets outside for flight</p>
<p>Each group makes their object take flight one after the other</p>
<p>Determine which team’s object went the farthest, and which the least</p>

</br>

<h2> Group discussion </h2>
<p>How did prototyping and testing help?</p>
<p>How did it feel working in secret vs. working openly?</p>
<p>How does this apply to our work at AC4D?</p>
