    <h4>Prototype Evolution</h4>
    <p>When I first started my prototype, I thought I was going to make an AR app to help babysitters gamify clean up time. It involved a child trying to identify what objects were not in place. Then, using the app find where it should go. Finally, once the object gets placed in its correct place, they would get a point. I had sketched out the idea and iterated on it. I got user feedbak on it from three different users. All of them said that the idea did not seem relevant but in the end, what did emerge was how useful it would be for a babysitter to have a way to know where objects usually are kept. </p>
    <p> One of the hardest things to determine was how to make AR a useful tool. Once my users helped me to narrow its function, determining how to test it became natural. I decided to make a lo-fi screen and play sounds that would indicate where the object is -- like a game where someone tells you that you are getting closer to the object.
    <h4>Prototype Feedback</h4>
    <p>My users were able to find the item. They really enjoyed it when there was a noise indicating that they had "won". They also said it would be useful to have clearer directions (i.e. what room is the object in? how can the directions be better paced?). </p>
    <h4>Prototype Improvements</h4>
    <p>In my next iteration, I would like to make the directions to the object feel more human-like. I would do this by having more vocabulary like "living room" and "look underneath". I also would want to figure out a way to prototype the important information the babysitter would need about the object such that it would float over the object. For example, babysitters should learn what is off-limits for the kids. A questions I am left with is how could the app empower babysitters to be able to say: you have to do what I am saying and I have the authority to tell you so.</p>
