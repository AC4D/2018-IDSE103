    <h5>IDSE103 - Assignment #4</h5>
    <h1>User Experiment</h1>
    <p>Part 1: Create high quality mockups in Sketch/XD of a feature in your iOS app that leverages Augmented Reality. The feature should enable at least 3 distinct tasks and fit into your cohesive toolkit from Assignment #3. Submit as high-resolution PNG files.</p>
    <p>Part 2: Construct a testable prototype of your Augmented Reality experience. You may use code, screen sharing, physical props or any other technique that works to communicate your idea, allows someone to interact with it, and you to gather feedback.</p>
    <p>
      Part 3: Test the prototype with 2 different people. At least 1 of them should have no previous knowledge of your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part 4: Document your prototype and testing by submitting:<br />
      - 5 high quality photos of your prototype being tested. (Begin with a wide-angle view of your setup and progress to the detailed interactions.)<br />
      - 1-3 minute video recording of your prototype being tested. Uploaded to youtube and embed in the HTML.<br />
      - Written responses to the following questions:<br />
      &nbsp; &bull; How did your design evolve while constructing the prototype?<br />
      &nbsp; &bull; What feedback was unexpected from testers?<br />
      &nbsp; &bull; How would you improve your prototype for future testing?
    </p>
